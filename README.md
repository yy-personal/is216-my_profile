Next, let's go update your **index.html**.
* The skeleton **index.html** is just a template.
* Update **index.html** with **your information**.
* Your Github repo is **private** and is only visible to your prof and TAs.

So far, the changes you've made reside locally on your computer. Your prof and TAs cannot see them.
* Let's push your **changes** (from local computer) to your (remote) GitHub repo.
* In **GitHub**, this takes 2 steps: **1) Commit** and **2) Push**.
* ---
* First, in your web browser, go to your own **My Profile** GitHub repo. <img src="images/GitHub_11.jpg" width="100px">
* In my case, my remote repo address is https://github.com/is216-supreme/my-profile-connectappsmu. Yours will be having a different suffix.
* ---
* In **Visual Studio Code**, look for this button on the left side. Click on it. 
* You will see this. It shows the previous file content on left (red) and new content on right (green). <img src="images/GitHub_12.jpg" width="800px">
* In the top left corner, you will see. <img src="images/GitHub_13.jpg" width="200px">
* Under **Changes**, you will see one or more files with changes made locally. In our case, we made changes to only 1 file. Click **Changes** (or index.html) and above it, in the text field, write briefly what this **commit** is for.
* When done, click the **tick** sign.
* You'll see this. Click **Yes**. <img src="images/GitHub_14.jpg" width="500px">
* Click on 3-dot sign. Click **Push**. <img src="images/GitHub_15.jpg" width="400px">
* ---- By now, your changes should've been pushed to your My Profile **remote** GitHub repo ---
* In **web browser**, go to your My Profile GitHub repo.
* Go there and click on **index.html**. Do you see the latest changes you just pushed from your local computer?
* Here's mine. Looks like it's updated! <img src="images/GitHub_16.jpg" width="500px">
